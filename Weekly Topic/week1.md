### Weekly Goals & Onboarding

The primary goal for this week is to get set up with the course's tools and understand its foundational concepts.

* **Tool Installation:**
    * **VSCode:** Install the code editor.
    * **Marp:** Install the VSCode extension for creating presentations from Markdown.
    * **GitHub:** Set up and familiarize yourself with Git/GitHub.
* **Understand Course Foundations:**
    * Review the **CSC 640 Course Rules**.
    * Read the introduction to **Software Engineering (SWE) as Problem Solving**.
    * Understand the **"Storytelling"** concept for the course.
    * Review the **8-week plan** based on the course assignments.

### Homework & Assignments

This week introduces three assignments, with one due immediately and two requiring long-term planning.

* **HW1 (Installation):**
    * This is the immediate homework.
    * It involves installing the required tools (VSCode, Marp, Git) and reading the introductory documents to understand the course's approach to SWE, projects, and high-quality software.
* **HW4 (Project):**
    * This is a **look-ahead** to the main course project.
    * You must **start thinking about your project** now.
    * You have two options:
        1.  Follow the provided tutorial to build a REST API.
        2.  Discuss and choose your own project with the instructor.
    * You need to understand the requirements for the project's two stages and three submissions.
* **HW5 (Documentation):**
    * This is also a **look-ahead** to a documentation assignment.
    * You will create documentation explaining "Software Quality" as if you were teaching your future team members.
    * You will also be assigned to peer-review the documentation of three other students.
    * You must upload your GitHub repository location so your reviewers can access your work.

### Key Concepts & Philosophy

The introductory lectures establish the mindset for the course.

* **SWE is Problem Solving, Not Coding:**
    * The core job of a software engineer is to solve a client's real-world problems and "manage complexity."
    * Coding is just a tool to achieve the solution. This remains true even with the rise of AI.
    * The main causes of project failure (which affects ~66% of projects) are **Complexity**, **"Unknown Unknowns"**, and **Human Factors**.
* **Definition of High-Quality Software (HQS):**
    * The goal is to build HQS, which is defined as software that meets user expectations and is **reliable**, **maintainable**, and **efficient**.
    * The course (CSC 640) is the answer to: "How do we use SWE to build and deliver HQS on time and within budget?"
* **Rules & Tools:**
    * The course will teach a set of **Rules** (e.g., KISS - Keep It Simple and Stupid, NS - No Surprises, DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself) and **Tools** (e.g., VSCode, GitHub, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Docker, Hugo) to manage complexity.
* **Learning Philosophy:**
    * The course philosophy is based on **learning by doing**.
    * It references the Richard Feynman quote: **"What I cannot create, I do not understand."** True understanding comes from building.
